If you're using the iDriver platform for transportation services or fleet management, accessing your account is essential to make full use of its features. Whether you’re a new user or simply need a quick refresher, this step-by-step guide will help you log in to your iDriver account smoothly.

Step-by-Step Guide to Login to Your iDriver Account
Step 1: Visit the iDriver Official Website
Open your preferred web browser and go to the official iDriver website. The URL is typically something like www.idriver.com — make sure you're on the correct site to avoid phishing attempts.

Step 2: Locate the Login Button
On the homepage, look for the Login or Sign In button. This is usually found at the top-right corner of the page. Click on it to proceed to the login page.

Step 3: Enter Your Login Credentials
On the login page, you'll need to enter the following:

Email address or Username: This should be the one you used during registration.

Password: Ensure you enter the correct password. Passwords are case-sensitive, so double-check for typos or caps lock.

Step 4: Click on "Login"
Once you’ve entered your credentials, click the Login or Sign In button. If your details are correct, you’ll be redirected to your dashboard or home screen.

Optional Steps
Forgot Password?
If you’ve forgotten your password, click the Forgot Password? link on the login page. You’ll be prompted to enter your registered email address to receive a password reset link.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
For added security, iDriver may offer two-factor authentication. If you have this enabled, you’ll need to enter a code sent to your phone or email to complete the login process.

Mobile App Login (If Available)
If iDriver offers a mobile app:

Download the app from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

Open the app and tap on the Login button.

Enter your credentials and follow the same steps as the web version.
